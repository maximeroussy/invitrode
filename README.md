## Summary
This is a lightweight and focused library. There's a single class with only a single public method that's accessible.

This library can be used in an infinite amount of ways:
- generate initial passwords for your user based applications
- suggest character names in your games
- find a unique name for your child
- the list goes on...

## Demo
Here's a simple Android app built with the library that demonstrates its usage:

</p>

This demo app is available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maximeroussy.invitrodeandroid).

## Download/Install
The library is available through Maven Central, which is included in your repositories by default on Android. For a Java 
project, make sure you have `mavenCentral()` added to your repositories.

### Gradle (preferred):

```gradle
implementation 'com.maximeroussy.invitrode:invitrode:2.0.2'
```

### Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.maximeroussy.invitrode</groupId>
  <artifactId>invitrode</artifactId>
  <version>2.0.2</version>
  <type>pom</type>
</dependency>
```

### Manual

You can grab the jar for the [latest release](https://github.com/maximeroussy/invitrode/releases) to include in your project manually.

## Usage
Using the library is extremely simple.

```java
WordGenerator generator = WordGenerator();
String myNewWord = generator.newWord(int lengthOfWord);
```

## Inspiration & Credits
Bi-gram source and general concept based on [Scrollback's generate.js](https://github.com/scrollback/scrollback/blob/master/lib/generate.js)  & described in [this blog post](https://www.hackerearth.com/notes/random-pronouncable-text-generator/)  by Aravind. This is a Java adaptation that will be further developed as a functional and feature rich random word generator.
